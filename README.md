# Unity Mathematical Surfaces Project

This Unity project uses game objects to display multiple and complex functions based on the tutorial [Mathematical Surfaces](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/mathematical-surfaces/) by [Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/).

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the visualization of various mathematical functions in Unity using game objects. The tutorial by Jasper Flick guides you through creating a function library, managing methods with a delegate and an enumeration type, and displaying both 2D and 3D functions.
